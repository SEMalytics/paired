# Platform for AI-Enabled Remote Development: Onboarding Guide

## Welcome to the Ecosystem!

This guide will help you understand the Platform for AI-Enabled Remote Development - an intelligent development system designed for continuous learning and improvement. This document serves as your entry point to the ecosystem's knowledge repositories and development practices.

## Quick Start: Knowledge Navigator System

The most important concept to understand first is our **Knowledge Navigator System**. This is your map to all knowledge repositories in the ecosystem.

### First Steps

1. Start by reading the master configuration file: `.pairedrules`
2. Next, explore the Knowledge Navigator: `.paired/docs/KNOWLEDGE_NAVIGATOR.md`
3. Follow the context gathering sequence in your first few days:
   - `.paired/contexts/context_discovery.md` (What we're currently working on)
   - `.paired/config/project_config.yml` (Project-wide settings)
   - `.paired/memory/ai_memory.md` (What we've learned so far)
   - `.paired/handoff/last_session.md` (Recent development activity)

## Core Development Philosophy

The Windsurf Ecosystem operates on a few fundamental principles:

1. **AI-First Development**: AI interaction principles guide all development
2. **Continuous Learning**: Every interaction is a learning opportunity
3. **Explicit Reasoning**: Document the rationale behind significant decisions
4. **Layered Rule Hierarchy**: AI principles first, language-specific rules second

## Directory Structure Overview

```
.paired/
├── agents/         - AI agent definitions and coordination
├── config/         - Project configuration files
├── contexts/       - Current project status and focus
├── docs/           - Documentation and architecture
├── handoff/        - Session transfer artifacts
├── memory/         - AI knowledge accumulation
├── performance/    - Metrics and tracking framework
├── rules/          - Organized rules files
├── scripts/        - Automation scripts
├── templates/      - Templates for commits, etc.
├── versions/       - Point-in-time snapshots
└── workflows/      - Development workflows
```

## Your First Commit

1. Follow the decision tree in the Knowledge Navigator
2. Consult the appropriate knowledge repositories based on your task
3. Use the commit template: `.paired/templates/commit_template.txt`
4. Apply the AI Reasoning Block Template for significant changes
5. Document your learnings in the AI memory system

## Getting Help

- For development workflows, check `.paired/workflows/`
- For context on architectural decisions, see `.paired/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- For rules integration understanding, see `.paired/docs/RULES_INTEGRATION.md`

## Key Documentation Files

- **Knowledge Navigator**: `.paired/docs/KNOWLEDGE_NAVIGATOR.md`
- **Architecture Overview**: `.paired/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Rules Integration**: `.paired/docs/RULES_INTEGRATION.md`

Welcome aboard! The Platform for AI-Enabled Remote Development is designed to make development more intelligent, efficient, and continuously improving. By following the Knowledge Navigator, you'll quickly become proficient in navigating and leveraging our ecosystem.
