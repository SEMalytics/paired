**Never code alone - Whether paired with AI or humans**

*Revolutionary middleware that transforms how developers collaborate* ✨

🎯 **Better together!** PAIRED is intelligent middleware that orchestrates AI resources across multiple platforms while pioneering true pair programming in the AI age. It's the bridge that connects everything you use, adds intelligence where needed, and disappears when not.

**"Partnership is our platform, collaboration is our code"** - The PAIRED manifesto.

## 🤖 Your 7-Agent Development Team

Each agent has **real capabilities** - not just chat responses:

- 👑 **Alex (PM)** - Project coordination and strategic planning
  - Real project planning tools and milestone tracking
- 🕵️ **Sherlock (QA)** - Quality investigation and code auditing
  - Runs actual code quality audits and metrics analysis
- 🏛️ **Leonardo (Architecture)** - System design and architectural patterns
  - Performs real architectural pattern detection and analysis
- ⚡ **Edison (Dev)** - Development implementation and debugging
  - Provides actual debugging assistance and development tools
- 🎨 **Maya (UX)** - User experience design and accessibility
  - Conducts real WCAG accessibility audits and UX analysis
- 🏈 **Vince (Scrum Master)** - Team coordination and process management
  - Manages actual sprint health monitoring and team processes
- 🔬 **Marie (Analyst)** - Data analysis and market research
  - Performs real market research and competitive analysis

## ✨ Why PAIRED is Revolutionary

- **🤝 Universal Bridge** - One platform, every AI, infinite collaboration
- **🔧 Real Agent Tools** - Each agent uses actual analysis tools, not just chat
- **🌍 Works Everywhere** - Same intelligent bridge connects any project
- **⚡ One-Command Magic** - Single activation script, instant agent team
- **💬 Seamless Integration** - Agents appear naturally in CASCADE chat
- **🛡️ Rock-Solid Reliable** - Manual activation (always works)
- **📚 Beautifully Simple** - Clear docs that respect your time

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Get your 7-agent AI development team running in 3 simple steps:**

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SEMalytics/paired.git
cd paired
./install.sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc for bash users
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
paired-init
```

### 3. Open Windsurf and Start Collaborating
```bash
windsurf .
```

**Test it works:** In Windsurf CASCADE chat, type: `Hi Alex!`

✅ **That's it!** Your 7 AI agents are ready to help - no additional commands needed!

## 📋 What Each Step Does

**Step 1** creates your global PAIRED system with all 7 agents and commands. The `source` command loads the new commands into your current shell.

**Step 2** sets up your project with agent memory and Windsurf integration.

**Step 3** opens Windsurf with automatic agent integration - the bridge starts automatically when you open the project.


## 🏢 Advanced Setup

### Quick Installation

**Core PAIRED Foundation:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMalytics/paired-pre-prod/main/install.sh | bash
```


### Team Deployment
```bash
# Each team member
scripts/install.sh

# Project lead
paired-init --team-mode
```

paired knowledge learn --interactive

# Get project context and recommendations
paired knowledge context

# Search project knowledge
paired knowledge search "authentication"
```
